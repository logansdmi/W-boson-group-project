# W-boson-group-project
PHAS0052 group project on the W boson self-coupling at the LHC with the ATLAS experiment using forward proton tagging.


Background and Methodology
The ATLAS detector at the LHC will be equipped    in Run3 by two far-away stations, located at about 220m from the interaction point along the beam line, that will measure events where the incoming protons, instead of having a head-on collision, only lose a (typically small) fraction of their energy and will therefore be deflected out of the beam by the LHC magnets. These events are particularly interesting because, unlike the head-on collisions, allow a fully kinematic reconstruction of the final state, which is particularly important for studies where the precise reconstruction of particle angles is essential, like the couplings of vector bosons. In this project simulated collisions from ATLAS will be used to extract the sensitivity of the experiment in measuring this coupling, under various assumptions. The project is purely based on data analysis, and can make use of machine-learning techniques

Suggested output
The aim of the project is to write an internal document about the sensitivity for measuring vector boson coupling with a proton tag. Based on previous theoretical studies (like https://arxiv.org/pdf/0912.5161.pdf) the students will use realistic detector simulation and conditions, and will extend it to the semileptonic case, that is expected to collect 4 times more events (but also to have more background).
